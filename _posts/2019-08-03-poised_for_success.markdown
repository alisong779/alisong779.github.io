After completing my Rails portfolio project I realized how far Ive come in this program yet at the same time I can see the gaps in my knowledge. The pace of the full time course is tough and, in my personal opinion, I dont think you truly have the time to retain or fully understand whats being taught. Of course with practice and repetitive use of the concepts and code in labs it helps to burn it all into the brain. I decided to change the pace of my cirriculum due to personal life interferences and because I came here to learn. I want to graduate this program with confidence and knowing that I have the skills and understanding to handle tech interview questions. For me, that means slowing it down a bit, taking the time to really understand each function, method, object, route, resource, validation, mvc, oop and all the crud in the mud Im trekking through. With hard work, patience and dedication I will become poised for success.
