Although the week started out bumpy, facing issues with Github vs Sandbox, I feel like I accomplished quite a bit in the end. Ive learned many things during this first portfolio project, the first and probably most important is when using Sandbox - delete the file that it opens with, clone your git repo into Sandbox, cd into the folder and then begin your work. Also, with many Sandbox crashes and after losing code a few times..its highly important to push your code to git often! I would say it was quite a challenge working between these two platforms, but at the end of the week I am very comfortable with it. 

The second important thing I have learned during this project is that while scraping data from a web page is cool and all, that data seems to change. I had issues with the returns of my Scraper methods changing from one day to the next. I wonder if there was a way to code around that, but at this point I dont have that knowledge. Scraping seems a bit unreliable for use in any large application, but was still great to learn and experiment with. 

Lastly, learning to code a CLI was the most difficult but most educational part of this project. The CLI is where most of the action happens, from calling Scraper methods, to printing out prompts, taking input from users, processing that input and performing actions based on input, the CLI is key. The greatest thing I learned during coding of the CLI is to manage all input appropriatly and to write methods in an effective way. Write methods to perform simple actions that can be called within the larger process methods, rather than jamming it all into one place. Its also key to only call the scraper once and only when needed. 

This first portfolio project was definitely a great learning experience and I do feel a bit more confident in my abilities through it. Its important to give lots of credit to our excellent Tech Coaches, who without them, Im sure none of us could have pulled this off. Thank you kindly for all of the time and effort you put into helping us through!
