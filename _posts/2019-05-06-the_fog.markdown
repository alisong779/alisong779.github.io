After 20 years working with aircraft, aircraft mechanics, and a corporate world I took a leap of faith and walked out quietly. I have a thing for computers and they seem to mostly enjoy my company, it felt like good chemistry and so I leaped into code land. I leaped hoping to build upon the relationship foundation, block by block. Little did I know in this land the fog would appear. The fog that sets over the mind when trying to reprogram the code thats been processing in my brain for two decades. The fog that clouds your logic and ability to think clearly. They say its like a puzzle, but never mention the number of pieces. Love it or hate it, youre submerged and there is no time to pause, look back or ponder the concepts too long. Just keep moving swiftly, peering at the sun as it breaks through in spots, slowly, hopefully, clearing the fog.
